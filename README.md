WELCOME
This project is to be viewed by the web development section of the CS club: Pablo Hernandez, Mahmut Under, Mathew Olivas, DonRichie Ewane, Armando Lerario, and the other guy(dont know his name)

NOTE FROM PABLO:
I made the mistake of confusing the ACM website with the CS Club website so if I caused any confusion I apoligize.

This website is going to imitate the current website. The site is a single html document with 6 main components:

1. HOME drop down menu consisting of: ABOUT US, SCHOLARSHIPS, and EVENTS LOG

2. EXTRA ASSIGNMENTS

3. HACKERS CORNER

4. PEER MENTORING

5.REPOSITORY drop down menu consisting of: 2018-2019, 2019-2020

6. SITEMAP
