WELCOME
This project is to be viewed by the web development section of the CS club: Pablo Hernandez, Muhammed (I dont know your last name), Mathew Olivas, DonRichie Ewane, Armando Lerario, and the other guy(dont know his name)

This project is going to be a  CRUD full-stack web and mobile application where students should be able to:
1. register an account
2. Login to said account
3. Earn, spend, and exchange a currency known as "tokens"
4. Use a qr code to interact with the club for various events

What the application will need: 
1. A backend database that can store user information
2. An interactive fronted that updates with the progression of the club

So far, of the 5 components that the website currently has, none will be static. Everything needs a form.

Personal suggestions from Pablo for the backend:
1. I think firebase would be a good fit for this application as like the current site, can handle user authentication, website hosting, and uses a real-time database to store files and update the front end. It is a complete back end as a service. Firebase also interacts with any programming language.

Here is a link to a brief overview of firebase:

 Introducing the web development team to Googles firebase would be benefical knowledge for future endeavors.

 Personal suggestions from Pablo for the frontend:
 1. React/ React Native. A Javascript framework that from personal experience is pretty neat in how it organizes the front-end and is a useful language for anyone pursuing web development as a career.
 
 2. Bootstrap. A CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end development
